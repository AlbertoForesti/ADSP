# Repository for the course of Applied Data Science Project (ADSP)
In this repository we store the code for training ML models for predicting fatalities in the Sahel region in the context of the course of the ADSP course at Politecnico di Torino .
## How to experiment
Run the notebook demo_final.ipynb to see the effects of causal data augmentation over the prediction of fatalities and over calibration.
## Exploring ACLED
With the notebook acled_data_exploration.ipynb it is possible to explore data about fatatlities and unrest in the Sahel region, with valuable insights over the kind of data that predictive models have to manage.
## The dashboard
Run dashboard.ipynb to see the results of the prediction of your run visualised, with possibilities of interaction.
