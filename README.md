# Repository for the course of Applied Data Science Project (ADSP)
In this repository we store the code for training ML models for predicting fatalities in the Sahel region.
## How to experiment
Run the notebook demo_final.ipynb to see the effects of causal data augmentation over the prediction of fatalities and over calibration.
The repository also stores analysis of the datasets we used and explored
