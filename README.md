# Repository for the course of Applied Data Science Project (ADSP)
In this repository we store the code for training ML models for predicting fatalities in the Sahel region in the context of the course of the ADSP course at Politecnico di Torino .
## How to experiment
Run the notebook demo_final.ipynb to see the effects of causal data augmentation over the prediction of fatalities and over calibration.
The repository also stores analysis of the datasets we used and explored
